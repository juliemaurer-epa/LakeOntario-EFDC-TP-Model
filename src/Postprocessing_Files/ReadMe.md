# Postprocessing Files

Files and scripts used to validate output for the Lake Ontario Total Phosphorus Model.

Files within TP_Field_Data contain raw field data and combined field data used to evaluate the model,
an R script used to generate modeled-vs-measured TP statistics and plots, and .csv files with model output 
and measured TP data for each model scenario. 

Files within MATLAB are code and output associated with an analysis of nearshore model comparison zones within 
the southwest nearshore of Lake Ontario.
