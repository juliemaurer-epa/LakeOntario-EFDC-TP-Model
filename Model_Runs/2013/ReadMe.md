# Model runs for 2013
Simulation period: April 1st, 2013 - September 30th, 2013.

The files within each folder contain:
1. CGEM - a compiled executable with the correct river load scenario.
2. data/ directory containing the file path to model inputs.
3. GD_InputFile_TP - a file containing simulation specifications, switches in CGEM, river loads, and boundary conditions.
4. _error and _out files - outputs of sbatch script.
5. lake_ontario_efdcPar.sh - sbatch script for running model remotely.
6. ReadMe file - containing notes on the river load scenario used.

Model runs are examples of various loading scenarios used to develop and validate the Lake Ontario Total Phosphorus model. 
Results from these simulations are published in:
